# Graphical Traveling Tool System
The Graphical Traveling Tool System is a GUI application that serves as a tool for travelers to manage their expenses and activities. In it, the user will be able to compare the different choices of expenses that they are being offered during a journey as well as tracking their plans.
The user will be able to add lists of expenses for each journey that they choose to add to their profile, which can be accessed when inputting a username and a password (the userâ€™s account will be recorded in a serialized file as soon as the user creates the account). The idea of this program is to allow travelers and tourists to choose the most optimal way to spend their money during a journey without the need for a traveling agency or complex thinking.

# Functionality
The Graphical Traveling Tool System is intended to be simple and easy to use, while still using complex mathematical ideas.  Each journey will have a list of destinations, and each destination will have a list of expenses and a TODO list for the user to carefully plan their expedition. The application will also include a simulation that uses the mathematical concept of weighted graphs to find the shortest path and lowest price of the journey that the user will choose to take, as well as display all the other possibilities to allow the user to carefully consider their options.
